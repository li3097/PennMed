Overall the project went well. I enjoyed adding the html tags and then going through the css part. It was neat to see the little changes that added up to the project. It challenges me a touch but generally I knew what was going on and have done some of this in the past. Its all in the little details that make this the beautiful project it needs to be. 

The topnav is supposed to be a red background with padding space. I seem to need to work on this bit. 

Also I have tried to put the logo, name, and search bar side by side but also I need to expand my skills on this as well. 

I tried the carousel with the pictures and I clearly need to work on this.

The placement text under the carousel of pictures needs to be centered which I attempted in my styles.css page but it also needs work. 

I have an extra star and calendar on my middle section under the carousel pictures. I seem to not be able to improve this. 

The funding opporunitites list is supposed to be in 2 columns. I could use some advice here on how to best approach this. 

The Upcoming events needs spacing between the days and event name but I could also use some advice here. Can I just have a mentor walk me through some of this? 

The bottom row looks most like its supposed to but I need some guidance on the grey background behind the Contact us with the map as well. 

The padding and or margin needs help in the Social section but I have messed with it for a bit but I need to refresh my skills on this.

The footer just needs the text color changed but the styles.css section has it there so I am unsure what is going on here.
